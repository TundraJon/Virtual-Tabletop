### Split index.html into HTML, CSS and JS (pure move)

Split the single-file app into three files so each part can be worked on separately. No behavior, markup, style or logic changes. `keep.html` remains the untouched single-file backup.

- [x] `styles.css`: new file, the exact contents of the former `<style>` block, moved verbatim.
- [x] `script.js`: new file, the exact contents of the former `<script>` block, moved verbatim (including the final `init();` call).
- [x] `index.html`: `<style>` block replaced by `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=1">` in the head; `<script>` block replaced by `<script src="script.js?v=1"></script>` in the same spot at the bottom of `<body>`. All other markup untouched.
- [x] Cache-bust started: `styles.css?v=1`, `script.js?v=1`.

**Verification:** a script that stitches `styles.css` and `script.js` back into `index.html` produced a result identical to `keep.html`. Playwright (Chromium, served locally) loaded `keep.html` and `index.html` side by side and compared the results: zero JS errors on both; all three files returned 200; splash fades to opacity 0; sidebar opens from the hamburger; Map and Help tabs switch; body background `rgb(17, 17, 17)`; 10 color swatches; canvas sized to the viewport. Screenshots of the two pages are identical. **Not verified here:** touch gestures (long-press to add a token, drag, pinch-zoom), folder loading and the calibration flow. These need a real-device check.

## Build Planner

Resolved, built, dropped, or superseded items are deleted from this section. Their history lives in the Build Log.

All items below are ideas only. None are designed, queued or authorized to build. Priority order is still to be decided.

### Known gaps in the current app

- **Mouse / desktop input:** the canvas only listens for touch events, so token placement, dragging, panning and zoom do nothing with a mouse. Open question: also add wheel zoom?
- **Save and restore:** a reload wipes tokens, calibration and the selected map; only the folder names are remembered. Open questions: autosave to localStorage, export/import as a file, or both? Map and token images are blob URLs and can't be saved directly.
- **Feet-per-square stored as a string:** `grid.ftPerSq = this.value` stores text, not a number. Distance math currently works by coercion. Log only; fix if/when authorized.
- **Undo:** no way to undo a token move, delete or HP change.

### Table features other VTTs do well

- **Initiative tracker:** turn order, current-turn highlight, round counter. Open questions: manual entry or built-in roll? Tied to tokens?
- **Conditions / status icons:** icons on tokens (stunned, prone, etc.). Open question: fixed list or user-defined?
- **Fog of war:** GM reveals the map as players explore. Open questions: paint-to-reveal, grid-cell reveal, or both?
- **Area templates:** cone, circle, line and cube overlays for spells and effects, snapped to the grid.

### Innovative ideas

- **True-size mode:** calibrate to the physical screen so one square equals exactly 1 inch, letting a tablet laid flat serve as a map for physical minis. Open question: how to calibrate (known device size, or a measure-with-a-ruler step)?
- **Custom token stats:** replace the fixed HP bar with user-defined bars (stamina, morale, armor, etc.), keeping the app system-agnostic and suited to custom combat systems. Open questions: how many bars, and how are they defined?
- **Player view:** a second screen (TV or tablet) shows the map and fog while the phone keeps the GM controls. Open question: how to link the screens with no server?
- **Encounter presets:** save a map with its tokens, positions and HP as one file and reload it in one tap. Likely shares work with save and restore.
- **Waypoint ruler:** measure a path with turns, and mark difficult terrain that costs extra movement.
- **Installable offline app:** make it a PWA, then wrap it for Google Play. Needs the HTML/CSS/JS split (done) and a manifest and service worker.

### Requested by Jon

- **Character sheets:** basic character-sheet panels that expand up from the bottom of the screen. Open questions: system-agnostic fields or a template per game? Linked to map tokens?
- **Dice roller:** a roller that looks cool (animated dice). Open questions: which dice (d4 through d100, custom)? 2D or 3D? Roll history? Modifiers? Accessible from the character sheet?
